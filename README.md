Aari - Your Virtual Assistant
Aari is a simple virtual assistant written in Python. It serves as a basic voice-controlled assistant that can perform various tasks such as searching on Wikipedia, opening websites, and executing commands on the system.

To run Aari, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
pyttsx3
speech_recognition
wikipedia
webbrowser

How to Use
Upon running the script, Aari will greet you based on the time of day.
It will listen for your command.
You can give commands such as:
Ask questions like "What is the capital of France?"
Open websites like "Open YouTube."
Execute "Open code" to launch Visual Studio Code.
Aari will respond accordingly and perform the requested actions.

Future Integration
I am planning to integrate AI capabilities into Aari to enhance its functionality as a chatbot. This will enable Aari to provide more intelligent and context-aware responses, thereby improving the user experience. Stay tuned for updates!
